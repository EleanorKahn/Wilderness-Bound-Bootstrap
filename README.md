### Reflection
Wilderness Bound (Bootstrap) was my first web framework, and my introduction to many fundamental web development concepts, such as responsive design, state, building/deployment, and code components. 

I completed this project first in late summer 2021, then redid it in early 2023 when I returned to studying after medical hiatus.
